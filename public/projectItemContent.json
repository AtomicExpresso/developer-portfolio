This project was developed using Next.js, TypeScript, SASS, and Bootstrap. Next.js leverages the App Router for efficient navigation, improved SEO, and server-side rendering (SSR) for faster page loads. TypeScript ensures code maintainability and type safety, while SCSS provides more organized CSS styles. Bootstrap is used for its pre-defined styles, enabling a responsive and visually appealing design."
