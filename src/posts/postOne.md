Developer portfolios are an excellent tool for making a lasting impression on potential clients or recruiters. In this article, I'll walk you through how I built my portfolio and my thought process behind it.

### **Things to consider**

When i was building my portfolio, i wanted the visitor to be able to:

- Find my portfolio easily on the internet
- Easily contact me, using either social media or email
- See my projects and what kind of work i do

### **Deciding on a theme**

Before I started building my portfolio website, I wanted to look through some other developer portfolios to give me some ideas, fortunately  I found a [github repo](https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios) that had a huge list of them.

When I was choosing my theme, I wanted something that would not only reflect my skills and experience but also capture attention and leave a positive impression on the visitor. I decided to go with a creative and modern approach to my theme.

By opting for a creative and modern theme, I'm signaling to visitors that I try to think out-of-the box and I'm able to keep up with the latest trends in UI design.  Overall, this theme speaks to who I am as a developer; someone who values creativity, and innovation.

### **Key features**

Once I settled on a theme, I dived into the project build. For the tech stack, I chose React, Sass, Typescript and Bootstrap for the front-end. For the back-end i choose Nextjs and of course, nodejs.

I orginally built the project without typescript and nextjs, however as my skills improved. I optted for using typescript to help improve scaleabilty and ensure type safety. Then i learned Nextjs to use server side rendering, increase performence and improve SEO.

#### **Home page**

The home page is the first thing a user sees, as such it's important for it to contain important info while also being easy to navigate / read. When designing this section, my main objective was to:

- Give the visitor a brief introduction to who i am
- Display my skills, both development and tech related
- Showcase my projects

#### **Projects page**

The projects page shows the visitor the various projects i've worked on, i also included info about the tech stack i used and left links to see both a live view and the source code. I decided to only include major projects I've worked on so I could show my skills more in depth.

Additonally, i also plan on replacing these projects with better ones as my skills improve.

#### **Blog page**

Here you'll find articles I have written. The blog posts also go in depth about case studies and what sort of issues I solved. This helps give the visitor an idea about my thought process and how I solve potential problems in projects.

When I first built the website, I initally used json documents to hold the text content for the blogs. However, when I moved into nextjs, I also figured out how to use markdown, which made writing the blog articles a lot more easier and efficent.

#### **About me and contact**

Finally, on the About Me and Contact page, you'll find a deeper dive into who I am. The About Me section offers insights into my background and personality, giving visitors a better understanding of the person behind the projects.

The contact form allows people to send me an email directly from the website. I also made sure to add a max character limit to help prevent unnecessary long messages or spam

### **Conclusion**

That about wraps it up! That was the breakdown on how I built my portfolio from scratch. I built it entirely in TypeScript, Nextjs, and Sass. It turned out a lot better than I thought it would and i‚Äôm excited to continue refining and expanding my portfolio as my journey in tech progresses.
